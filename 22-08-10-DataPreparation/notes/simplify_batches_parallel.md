Simplify on the squared amplitudes takes quite long and does not fit into RAM.
- in batches
  - Simplify
  - append to file
  - don't mess up order with amplitudes

- parallel
  - each batch should be parallelized

- continue
  - should be able to stop anywhere and continue later
  - save progress to file
